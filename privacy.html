      <h2>2. Hosting</h2>
      <h3>External Hosting</h3>
      <p>
        This website is hosted externally. The personal data collected on this website is stored on the servers of the
        hosting provider(s). This may include, in particular, IP addresses, contact inquiries, metadata and
        communication data, contract data, contact details, names, website accesses, and other data generated via a

        <br>
        The external hosting is carried out for the purpose of fulfilling contracts with our potential and existing
        customers (Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO) and in the interest of a secure, fast, and efficient provision of our
        online offering by a professional provider (Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO). If corresponding consent is requested,
        the processing is carried out exclusively based on Art. 6 (1) lit. a DSGVO and § 25 (1) TDDDG insofar as the
        consent includes the storage of cookies or
        access to information in the user's end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG.
        Consent can be revoked at any time.<br>
        <br>
        Our hosting provider(s) will process your data only to the extent necessary to fulfill their performance
        obligations and follow our instructions regarding this data.<br>

      <h2>3. General Information and Mandatory Disclosures</h2>
      <h3>Data Protection</h3>
      <p>
        The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal
        data confidentially and in accordance with statutory data protection regulations as well as this privacy
        policy.<br>
        <br>
        When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data are data with which you can be
        personally identified. This privacy policy explains which data we collect and what we use them for. It also
        explains how and for what purpose this happens.<br>
        <br>
        We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating via email) can
        have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.
      </p>
      <h3>Notice on the Responsible Party</h3>
      <p>
        The responsible party for data processing on this website is:<br>
        <br>
        Max Mustermann<br>
        Musterstraße 1<br>
        12345 Musterstadt<br>
        <br>
        Phone: [Responsible party's phone number]<br>
        Email: mike.grupp.coding@gmail.com<br>
        <br>
        The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes
        and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).
      </p>
      <h3>Storage Period</h3>
      <p>
        Unless a more specific storage period is stated in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us
        until the purpose for the data processing no longer applies. If you make a legitimate request for deletion or
        revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible
        reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter
        case, the data will be deleted once these reasons no longer apply.
      </p>
      <h3>General Information on the Legal Bases for Data Processing on This Website</h3>
      <p>
        If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6 (1) lit. a DSGVO and
        Art. 9 (2) lit. a DSGVO if special data categories are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO. In the
        case of explicit consent for the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based
        on Art. 49 (1) lit. a DSGVO. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your
        end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on § 25 (1) TDDDG.
        Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data are required to fulfill a contract or to carry out
        pre-contractual measures, we process your data
        based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO. Furthermore, we process your data insofar as this is necessary to fulfill a
        legal obligation based on Art. 6 (1) lit. c DSGVO. Data processing may also be based on our legitimate
        interest under Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO. Information on the applicable legal basis in each case is provided in
        the following sections of this privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
      <p>
        In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. This occasionally necessitates
        the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only share personal data with external parties when
        this is required to fulfill a contract, when we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax
        authorities), when we have a legitimate interest under Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO, or when another legal basis
        permits the transfer of data. When using processors, we only transfer personal data of our customers based on a
        valid processing agreement. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
      </p>

      <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
      <p>
        Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent already
        given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by
        the revocation.
      </p>

      <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 DSGVO)</h3>
      <p>
        If the data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. e or f DSGVO, you have the right to object to the
        processing of your personal data at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation; this also
        applies to profiling based on these provisions. The respective legal basis on which processing is based can be
        found in this privacy policy. If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can
        demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms
        or the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims (objection under Art. 21 (1) DSGVO).<br>
        <br>
        If your personal data are processed for direct advertising, you have the right to object at any time to the
        processing of personal data concerning you for such advertising; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is
        associated with such direct advertising. If you object, your personal data will no longer be used for direct
        advertising purposes (objection under Art. 21 (2) DSGVO).
      </p>
      <h3>Right to File Complaints with Regulatory Authorities</h3>
      <p>
        In the event of DSGVO violations, affected individuals have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
        authority, particularly in the member state of their habitual residence, workplace, or the location of the
        alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or
        judicial remedies.
      </p>

      <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a
        contract delivered to you or a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct
        transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.
      </p>

      <h3>Information, Rectification, and Deletion</h3>
      <p>
        Within the scope of applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your stored
        personal data, their origin and recipients, and the purpose of data processing, as well as a right to correct or
        delete these data. You can contact us at any time regarding this or other questions about personal data.
      </p>

      <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any
        time for this. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this.
          During the verification period, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
          personal data.</li>
        <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing
          instead of deletion.</li>
        <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need them to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims,
          you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
        </li>
        <li>If you have filed an objection under Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balance must be struck between your interests
          and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the
          restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, such data – apart from their storage – may only be
        processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection
        of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European
        Union or a member state.
